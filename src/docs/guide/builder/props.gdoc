The *Jersey Request Builder* also allows the author to build a request gradually through a properties object. All of the properties that can be set inside of the
DSL-based methods can also be set directly on the properties itself.

{code}
RequestProperties requestProperties = new RequestProperties()

requestProperties.uri = "http://www.example.com"
requestProperties.accept = "text/html"

def result = jerseyRequestBuilder.get(requestProperties)
{code}
